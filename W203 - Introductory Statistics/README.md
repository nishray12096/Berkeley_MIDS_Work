# W203 - Introductory Statistics
In this course, we covered the basics of EDA, probability, hypothesis testing, and linear regression (including coefficient interpretation). The four major deliverables correspond to these areas and are all delivered in R markdown (RMD), which is used to knit a PDF report.

# List of documents:
*EDA_Corruption.pdf - shows use of different packages and techniques to explore a political corruption dataset in Rstudio
*Probability_Theory.pdf - shows answers to a basic probability worksheet
*HypothesisTesting.pdf - shows hypothesis testing using  built in statistical testing packages and a manual recreation of the t-test for comparison's sake
*Regression_Crime.pdf - uses a regression study for insight discovery in crime rates
