# W210: Capstone Project
This course allowed groups of students to build a data science project. Our group built CodeAssist: an intelligent system that parses patient demographics, preoperative notes, and post operative notes to automatically suggest CPT codes to bill for the given procedure. Due to the sensitive nature of the data and our partnership with Perimatics (a healthcare data science group), I will not share code for this project. Slides detailing the work and the performance achieved are available in "Hospital Billing - Final". Please contact me if you're curious for more details!
