# W241 - Experiments and Causality
This course centered on causal inference and experiment design. We studied A/B testing in detail: including challenges in data collection (e.g. non-compliance) and analysis (e.g. difference-in-difference setups, differential effects)

Assignments/Essay1_NishantVelagapudi.pdf - an analysis of a flawed conclusion from a study (in this particular case, a link between bacon consumption and cancer)
Assignments/Essay2_NishantVelagapudi.pdf - a proposed research study to understand how time-to-draw affects image classification accuracy. The goal is to understand how CNN filters in image classification compare to human perception by comparing human and machine classification accuracies on images with differing degrees of detail.

HappyDogs_Final.pdf - final project determining the effect of puppy videos on stress. We achieved this by collecting stress signals (bp, blood oxygenation, pulse rate) before and after watching a video of puppies (treatment) and a video of visual white noise (control). Our analysis began with a power study to understand how much data we needed given the expected effect size and concluded by slicing effect by demographics such as age, BMI, exercise, and gender.
