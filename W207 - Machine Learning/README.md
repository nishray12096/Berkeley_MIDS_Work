# W207: Introduction to Machine Learning
Assignments:
All assignments revolved around implementing some kind of ML algorithm:
Nishant_Velagapudi_p1.ipynb - digit classification using KNN and Naive Bayes classifiers. Work here revolved around understanding the KNN algorithm as well as different styles of NB models and how it applied to the problem of digit classification
Nishant_Velagapudi_p2.ipynb - text classification using a suite of models. Work here involved text featurization, text cleaning, hyperparameter selection, and targeted error investigation (leveraging different metrics for model performance)
Nishant_Velagapudi_p3.ipynb - unsupervised learning assignment. Work here involved dimensional reduction (PCA) + cluster creation and visualization to understanding the challenge of fixed-cluster algorithms. The assignment concludes with work on selecting number of PCA components and evaluating subsequent information loss.

Final:
Aimed to predict perioperative hyperglycemic incidents (classify whether a patient will have too high blood sugar levels during surgery). Files:
Final_PredictingPerioperativeHyperglycemicIncidents.pptx - high level overview of project
FinalProject_Notebook.ipynb - fully annotated project notebook with writeup. Walks through parameter sweeps, cross validations for algorithm selection, text featurization + cleansing, variable selection based on patient stage, and final model results
